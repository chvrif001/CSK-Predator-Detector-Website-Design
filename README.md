# CSK-Predator-Detector-Website-Design
This project is a dynamic website built using HTML and PHP that allows image uploads from a microcontroller — and displays the uploaded images on a public webpage.

**Note:** GitHub Pages does not support server-side PHP execution. This repository is for version control only — to run the site, you must host it on a PHP-enabled server.
